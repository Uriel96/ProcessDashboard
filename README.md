# Process Dashboard

Process Dashboard is a software program developed using C# 6.0 and .NET Framework 4.6.1. 

The purpose of this project was to speed up the process of reading each student's projects and have a place where important data was shown and stored. 
Therefore, the main objective of this project was to, through a software program, ease up the data of each student's projects in a way which data could be easily seen and handled for further analysis.

All the Students Projects are in a Directory.
