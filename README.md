# Process Dashboard

Process Dashboard is a software program developed using C# 6.0 and .NET Framework 4.6.1. 

The purpose of this project was to speed up the process of reading each student's projects and have a place where important data was shown and stored. 
Therefore, the main objective of this project was to, through a software program, ease up the data of each student's projects in a way which data could be easily seen and handled for further analysis.

All the Students Projects are in a Directory.

And each student's project consists of a Zip File which contains all the data for the corresponding project.

This Zip File is generated by a software program called 'Process Dashboard' which collects multiple metrics done by the students through the project. This metrics are used by the Personal Software Process (PSP) or the Team Software Process (TSP) metodology.

A project is separated into programs, where the student must work within one program before given up. Then the other program is done and given up, this means that programs are acumulating through the project.

Each project contains Time Log metrics, Defect Log metrics, Proxy Based Estimated Methods (PROBE), Size Estimated Template (SET) parts, Phases metrics, and Summaries of each program. All these metrics are contained within the Zip File.

This software is responsible of generating an Excel File where all important data is contained. Also it is capable of storing this information in a SqLite Database (local database), this way all data for different students throughout the years are stored, and can be analysed.
This is how the program looks like:
