# Dashboard Reader

Dashboard Reader is a software program developed using C# 6.0 and .NET Framework 4.6.1. 
The Database side was developed using SQLite and Entity Framework Core 7.0.0-beta8. Also, to extract Zip Files it was neccesary to install DoNetZip Library. Link: https://dotnetzip.codeplex.com/

Note: Project name was changed from Process Dashboard to Dashboard Reader.

The purpose of this project is to speed up the process of reading each student's project data and have a place where that data is shown and stored for its analysis.

All the Students Projects are in a Directory.

And each student's project consists of a Zip File which contains all the data for the corresponding project.

## Process Dashboard
This Zip File is generated by a software program called Process Dashboard (http://www.processdash.com/) which collects multiple metrics done by the students through the project. This metrics are used by the Personal Software Process (PSP) metodology.

A project is separated into programs, where the student must work within one program, and send the process dashboard data when it's done. The data is acumulated throught the project while the student works in each program.

Each program contains the time, size and defect metrics, through the Time Log, Defect Log, Proxy Base Estimation (PROBE), Size Estimation Template (SET). All these metrics are contained within the Zip File.

## Program Specifications
This software is responsible of generating an Excel File where all important data is contained. Also it is capable of storing this information in a SqLite Database (local database), this way all data for different students throughout the years are stored, and can be analysed.
This is how the program looks like:

**Dashboard Directory:** The main directory where all the folders with each students information is.

**Excel File:** The Excel Template File that contains the format in which information will be presented.

**Prefix:** The first Words to identify the Zip File. e.g. if provided 0dsh as prefix, then it will search for a Zip File starting with 0dsh

**Generate Excels:** Whether or not Excels for each student will be generated.

**Save in Database:** Whether or not data will be stored in the local database.

**Delete Old Excels:** Whether or not Excels contained in the student's folder will be deleted.

**Generate Only One:** Whether or not information will be generated for only a particular student.

**Acumulated Excel:** Whether or not another Excel will be generated with all the information of each student.

**Generate Automatically:** If the last program of each student information is not known.

**Generate Until:** If the last program of each student is known. This Program must be chosen in the Combobox.

**Progress Bar:** Shows how much progress is done on generating all the information.

**Excecute:** Excecutes the Process Generation.

**Cancel:** Stops the process of generation.

**Show Database:** Shows a new Window with a query to find the information needed in the database.

Data Window lets you query basic information from the Database, such as student, table, until program and show previous versions:

**Student:** The Name of the Student. Can be chosen from the Combobox or written.

**Table:** The type of Data to show (Defect Logs, Time Logs, Phases, Summaries, PROBE and SET)

**Until Program:** The Programs that want to be shown. e.g. if Program 3 is chosen means Program 1, 2 and 3 will be shown.

**Show previous versions:** Whether previous versions of the student will be shown (previous generated data for the student).

## Excel Files
Generated Excel Files are the must important part of this software, because it will allow data to be analysed. This analysis will not be shown because of confidentiality purposes, but the generated data will. 

When the Process is finished an Excel file is generated for each Student in their given directory.

And the Information of the Student's project will look something like this:

Lastly an Acumulated Excel can be also generated, it stores all the Information of every student.
